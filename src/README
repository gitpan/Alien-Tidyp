tidyp is a fork of tidy on SourceForge at http://tidy.sf.net.  The
library name is "tidyp", and the command-line tool is also "tidyp"
but all internal API stays the same.

If you're using GCC and GNU make, here's how to build:

    $ cd build/gmake
    $ make

To run the test suite:

    $ cd test
    $ ./testall.sh
