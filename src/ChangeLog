Changelog for libtidyp

1.02    Mon May 10 00:57:45 CDT 2010
====================================
Updated some build problems.  The "make check" target should now build
correctly.


1.00    Sun Apr 25 00:53:14 CDT 2010
====================================
Removed -Wextra compiler flag for GCC.  Older GCCs don't handle this,
and it's really only for developer use anyway.

Add a new "make check" target.

Add a "tags" build target.

Removed all the commented-out code I could find.


0.99    Mon Feb 22 00:19:30 CST 2010
====================================
Distributed with a ./configure script.  No need to mess with autoconf.

Removed RPM and MSVC support.  If anyone wants, they can ask for it
and I'll add it back.  For now, I have no reason to think that they
actually work.

Removed the tab2space executable.

Added a version number, and removed the Release Date functionality.
A release date is not a usable version number.

The function tidyVersion() has been added.

The function tidyReleaseDate() has been removed.
